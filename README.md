=========================

Import into eclipse, deploy to android device with API 9. Device must support OpenGL ES 2.0 (This is difficult to run in the emulator, we reccomend a real tablet or phone).

Open application and begin playing Yahtzee! Tap either the 2D or 3D dice to hold dice. Shake the device or tap the shake icon to roll the device. Try tapping the name of a score area if you forget the rules of yahtzee. Open the probabilities drawer for some statistics on the chances of making certain combinations.
